# Medieval Engineers Mod: [0.7.1] Additional Item Tags
This repo is a mod for Medieval Engineers that aims to be a global library for custom item tag definitions that other mods can refer to (i.e. for crafting recipe dependencies).

If you want to add your own tags, please refer to the scheme from [ItemTags.sbc](https://github.com/gesp-shad/ME-Mod-Additional-Item-Tags/blob/master/Data/ItemTags.sbc).
Also, add the information to what item in which mod your tag refers to give modders more transparency. And don't forget to add your icon files!
